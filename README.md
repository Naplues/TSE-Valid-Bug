# TSE-Valid-Bug
This repository proposes the supplementary materials for our paper - Chaff from the Wheat: Characterizing and Determining Valid Bug Reports.

# Data for replication
The zip file `arff data.zip` contains all the arffs files to run our experiments on the studied five projects. For each projects, we have 10 folds, which are stored into 10 folders, respectively. In each folder, there is a file named `train_final.arff` and a file named `test_final.arff`, which are the train and test file in each fold.
